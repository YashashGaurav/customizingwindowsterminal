# Customizing Windows Terminal

I could finally install Windows terminal and make the customizations I wanted to for my cmd.

Most of my changes, as of yet, are for the visual appeal, but hope to add more as I learn more.

## Usage

The `src` folder would contain:
1. `settings.json` file with plenty of comments to make it is easy for you to customize to your liking.
2. `winterminal.reg` file that on merging (just double click) will enable you to 'Windows Terminal Here' into any folder.
